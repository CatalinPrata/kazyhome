## Smart home and IoT home pet project


This is an experimental home project, updates will be available based on my personal time, **use it at your own risk!**

## Currently the project has:
- code for an Android application that can connect to an ESP8266
- code for an ESP8266 board that remotely(through a server)/locally(a button) switches on/off a relay 


You can see how to build it [here][myandroidsolutionsUrl].


## Future enhancements:
- better wifi connection handling/persistence for ESP8266
- handle the relay spike hardware wise and not having to do hacks on the button handling for eg.
- enhance the Android project by encapsulating the smart thing and create an abstraction for future things
